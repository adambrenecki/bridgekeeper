Changelog
=========

0.9
---

- :class:`~bridgekeeper.rules.R` objects were added. Many other types of rule classes are now deprecated.
- **Breaking change:** :class:`~bridgekeeper.rules.Relation` and :class:`~bridgekeeper.rules.ManyRelation` no longer require the model class on the other side of the relation to be passed in as an argument.
- **Breaking change:** :class:`~bridgekeeper.rules.ManyRelation` removes the ``attr`` argument, requiring only ``query_attr``.
- **Breaking change:** Django versions older than 2.2 are no longer supported.

0.7
---

Add :class:`~bridgekeeper.rules.In` permission class, and two predefined rule instances, :data:`~bridgekeeper.rules.current_user` and :data:`~bridgekeeper.rules.in_current_groups`.

0.5
---

- Minor Django REST Framework-related fixes.

0.4
---

- Added initial support for Django REST Framework.
- Documentation improvements.

0.3
---

- Renamed **predicates** to **rules**, because the latter is a more accessible term that describe the concept just as well. Besides, "permissions are made up of rules" sounds a lot better than "permissions are made up of predicates".
- Renamed **ambient predicates** to **blanket rules**, because it's a more descriptive name. Note that the ``@ambient`` decorator is now called ``@blanket_rule``, because having a ``@blanket`` decorator would be weird.

0.2
---

- Renamed ``bridgekeeper.registry.registry`` to :data:`bridgekeeper.perms`.
- Renamed ``bridgekeeper.predicates.Predicate.apply()`` to :meth:`~bridgekeeper.predicates.Predicate.check`
- Changed :meth:`bridgekeeper.predicates.Predicate.filter` so that it takes the user object as the first argument, for consistency with the rest of the library (i.e. it's singnature went from ``filter(queryset, user)`` to ``filter(user, queryset)``).
